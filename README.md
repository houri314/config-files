### config-files
Some configuration files I use for my Linux box. \
Including: Vim and Neovim config files, Picom, Alacritty, Zsh\
## Installation
You should copy the files manually to their directories to see which file you want
and which you don't. However, `install.sh` is there if you want to quickly clone
your system setup.
